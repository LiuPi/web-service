# Say Hello
### Web Service "Say Hello!"
###### On the main page there is a form with "User name", "User surname" and "User email" fields. Also there are "Say Hello!" and "Show user list" buttons.
###### "User name" and "User surname" fields are the key values for checking in the database.

  When "Say Hello!" button is pressed, if "User name" and "User surname" fields values were not entered yet, the "Hello, User name + User surname" message is displayed. Otherwise, 
the "Already seen you, User name + User surname" message is displayed.
  When "Show user list" button is pressed, the user list is displayed. If the database with users data is empty, the "The user list is empty" message is displayed.
